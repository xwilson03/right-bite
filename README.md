## Bite Right

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for RightBite came from a shared commitment to food safety and informed eating. We recognized the need for a tool that empowers consumers to make healthier choices by providing essential safety information about the food they purchase.

## What it does
RightBite is a straightforward food safety awareness app. It allows users to scan product barcodes or input the barcode to receive key health information. It assesses ingredient safety and provides a general safety rating for food items. Additionally, it color-codes ingredient lists and flags potentially dangerous ingredients. Additionally, RightBite offers 1-2 sentence product descriptions and notifies users of any recalls or lawsuits related to the product's company.

## How we built it
RightBite was built using a combination of technologies, including Typescript, Next.js, TailwindCSS, MongoDB Atlas, and Cheerio to get product data in order to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface. 

## Challenges we ran into
- We had to switch between multiple approaches of receiving product information using UPC
- Multiple camera components were difficult to configure, but we finally settled on one that was able to successfully parse barcode information

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We are proud of being able to figure out how to make the camera successfully scan a barcode.
- We're particularly proud of creating an app that puts the power of informed eating directly into the hands of consumers. RightBite has the potential to make a positive impact on the health and safety of individuals and communities in a fast, efficient way. 

## What we learned
- Half of the team was new to the T3 stack and there was a steep learning curve. We are now able to confidently say that we understand Next.js

## What's next for RightBite
- We want to be able to display macronutrient information so that the app is a one-stop shop for health and safety information of a product.
- Eventually, we want to convert our code to react-native code so it can be available as an app on all platforms.
